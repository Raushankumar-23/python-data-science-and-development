I created a file named hello.txt
and wrote some content into it using Java file handling.
I used write mode to add multiple lines of text to the file and then closed it properly to save the data.
After writing, I opened the same file in read mode to verify the content. 
This practice helped me understand how to create files, 
write data, read data, and manage files safely in Java.
