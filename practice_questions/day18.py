# 🔹 Day 16 – Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables (Job-Oriented)
# 🟢 Easy

# Create a class using constructor to initialize user data.

# Create a class with default and parameterized constructor.

# Create multiple objects and print their constructor values.

# Create a class where constructor prints a welcome message.

# Initialize object values dynamically using constructor.

# 🟡 Medium

# Create a class to track total number of users using class variable.

# Create a class where instance variables differ per object.

# Create a class where class variable is shared across all objects.

# Modify instance variable of one object and check others.

# Modify class variable and observe change in all objects.

# 🔴 Hard (Real-World)

# Create an APIRequest class that counts total requests made.

# Create a Dataset class that tracks number of datasets loaded.

# Create a TestCase class where each object has unique ID but shared status.

# Create a backend-style model using constructor + class variables.

# Create a class that logs how many objects were created and destroyed.
